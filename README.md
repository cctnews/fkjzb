　　男人似山，女人如水，这话不错。但全篇都是，似水柔情的女人玲珑剔透，温婉可人，恨不得把所有的女人都变作依人小鸟，这样的女人，才能轻灵地飘舞在男子的身边，有如桃红柳绿，片片桃花雨……一时语塞，不由困惑起来，呆呆地望着书本里的画面，而眼前，那荷，那水，那图中美好的景色，一时间都离我远远而去，就连那隐约荷香也在我的面前消散殆尽。
　　而看演义的功夫，看到一句话，我流过最长最美的路，即是陪你一道变老。这是我已经看《当你老了》的功夫也说过的一句话，此刻却再一次看到了!
　　我背朝着孤独的小店，向着暮霭更深更浓处走去。脚下的沙土是温热的，风是温热的，桔黄色的阳光也是温热的，俯身黄昏的灌木丛，向我摇摆着他们宽厚、粗糙的手臂，在这样一个荒凉之野，我却感受到了巨大的温馨、祥和，还有安宁，让你置身其中瞬间被其融化，让你的孤寂、凄凉、激动、惊喜的感受搅和掺杂，难以份辨，更难以言说。其实你也无法言说，这么大的旷野，你兀自说的那些话倾刻间被风吹散，最后只剩下沉默的你，和沉默着的原野，你不用伪饰，不必戴着面具，在这里，你尽可以删除身上的一切累赘之物，卸下伪装，还原一个原本的你，一个作为大自然一个分子的你。
Actually, I'm home also has a detergent, 84 is in the corner, peracetic acid;
I also know that detergent is the bane of "SARS", but, I am useless.
It's not that I intentionally indulgence "SARS", but because I don't have the heart to let a yard full of flowers and plants for their health to suffer.
You see, deep red roses, pink rose, is blooming on the green lawn fragrance;
Fresh vine branches covered with rice in axillary spit out the spikelet, brewing sweet tomorrow;
Little FIG curled up between branches and leaves, like a sleeping baby do the dream;
Of day lilies as rustic laughter of the young girl, and stretching the arm;
The asparagus on the balcony with a pieces of pale green cloud in the wind;
And the graceful bamboo shoots, like a teenager is gaining lingyun...
.
In the face of all this, I can for the sake of his desperate efforts are not affected by "SARS" and use a disinfectant to threat the lush life?
They, also is a child of nature!
By comparison, their skin is very delicate, their life is very fragile, they had just experienced the ravages of winter, growth is far greater than a year old a vicissitudes of life bumpy;
And they always use their own strong inspiring people's morale, with his own life the hope of supporting the people settle in people's hearts with his own fragrance, with his sweet sweet with the life of people, how could I have the heart to have experienced under them?
Kung fu people old, at the moment that ulmus parvifolia had disappeared.
Following cities and JiZhenHua set up, but the century in my old house in the countryside can catch a glimpse of ulmus parvifolia has seemed tooth gaping head boy.
Of branches withered leaves, and noble blood, where stand alone.
I think soon they will HeGuoHuai, willow living museum into the park, it is people's pain for a long time.
